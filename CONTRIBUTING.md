# Contributing to BloomBus-AI
Welcome and thank you for being interested in contributing to BloomBus-AI!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the BloomBus-AI repo. Please use your best judgment when contributing, and please feel free to propose changes or additions to this document.

## Issues
We have templates for both bugs and feature requests; feel free to use either for your issue. (or write your own issue if it's neither)

## Pull Requests
We have a template for PRs. Depending on the time of the year, PRs may receive a quick response or might sit around for a bit; if there's no quick response just hang in there we'll eventually get to it. (Contributed code is preferred to be in [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)'s default code style.)

# Thank you!
Your contributions to this project will help make getting around Bloomsburg, PA as a Bloomsburg University student easier and safer, and help the open source community in Bus-Tracking AI! Thank you for taking your time to contribute.
